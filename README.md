As the volume of online transactions has surged, so too has the ingenuity of fraudsters. They employ ever-evolving tactics to deceive systems, manipulate data, and gain unauthorized access,the spectrum of fraudulent activities is vast and constantly evolving.

Real-time fraud detection is not just about catching fraud after it has occurred; it's about preventing it from happening in the first place.The need for real-time detection in the face of rapidly occurring fraud is paramount. As digital transactions become even more integral to our daily lives, the ability to preempt fraudulent actions by operating at the same speed becomes an indispensable safeguard for individuals and businesses alike.

## Project Overview:
This project creates a real-time fraud detection system that seamlessly combines big data 
technologies and advanced machine learning. Utilizing Spark, Cassandra, and Spring Boot, the 
solution accurately spots fraudulent activities, bolstering transaction security and elevating 
customer experiences. Designed to train on real-time data, it operates alongside live transactions, 
swiftly identifying and addressing fraud. This approach aligns with the "Machine Learning Based 
Fraud Detection System" theme, harnessing machine learning, real-time data processing, and 
streamlined visualization for proactive fraud prevention, enhancing financial security and
